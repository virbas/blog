I'm Linas Ozeraitis, an engineer spending my days architecting Augmented and Virtual realities. Through the years I worked in automotive, AEC, advertising and life science industries adding layers of digital holograms onto our own, physical reality, mastering WebXR, Unity and so far my favorite one - Hololens.

I'm currently working as a Mixed Reality engineer at [Apprentice.io](https://apprentice.io).
Apprentice is a life science software company that helps life science manufacturers get treatments to patients faster by providing one platform to turn molecules into medicine. Our Tempo Manufacturing Cloud platform lets you scale up and out with unprecedented speed and accuracy across all stages of drug production - from preclinical, to clinical and commercial manufacturing. 
Mixed reality is deeply rooted into our software development and is intended to assist our customers in unique and interactive ways in the laboratory and suite. We currently work with ARCore, RealWear and Hololens technologies.

I will post a series of articles about some challenges we had to face while developing Hololens apps here at Apprentice and some explanations on how we solved them. Hopefully some of you will find it useful.
